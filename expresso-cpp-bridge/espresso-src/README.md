# README

The original Espresso code comes from the 1989 Berkeley code (https://embedded.eecs.berkeley.edu/pubs/downloads/espresso/index.htm). See the COPYING file for original code license.

This distribution is based on the C99 port of the excellent work made by Andrew to simplify and port to C89 standards (https://github.com/Rupan/espresso/tree/master/jni/espresso).

That has been edited to compile in visual studio/windows.
