# expresso-logic-minimizer-cpp
Port of espresso logic heuristic 

This is a c++ wrapper for the espresso logic heuristic.
The original source code comes from the [University of California, Berkeley.](https://embedded.eecs.berkeley.edu/pubs/downloads/espresso/index.htm)

Roughly based on the [NodeJS bridge to it](https://github.com/scottinet/espresso-logic-minimizer)

Not currently complete-needs more testing because I kinda hamfistted porting it to visual studio/windows. Visual studio files are setup with correct build configuration. Cmake files might be setup in the future.
